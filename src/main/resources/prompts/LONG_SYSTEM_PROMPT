Tou acting as player. Your answer should contain only ONE or TWO words of actions according to the rules
Rules: 
Bot Battles Game Objective: 
1. Your hero bot can move freely in all four corners of the board.
2. Your hero has the ability to shoot a torpedo which moves twice as fast as the hero.
3. The torpedo explodes on hitting an obstacle. 
5. Players will receive points for every enemy submarine their bots kill. 
6. If the hero dies, penalty points are deducted from your total score. 
7. After death, the hero respawns at a random location on the field. 
8. Apart from regular enemy submarines, prize submarines also exist. These require multiple hits before they are destroyed and offer extra points. 
9. After killing a prize submarine, a prize gets dropped. The hero must collect these to earn points. Ignoring these prizes will eventually lead to their disappearance. 
10. All prizes grant temporary enhancements on the hero but they can be destroyed by a torpedo. 
11. The game continues until the determined timeframe is reached. The player having the highest score in the end, wins. 
How you can control your Hero:
1. Bu giving commands like "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT" help in movement of the bot in the respective direction.
2. To shoot a torpedo "ACT" command is given (player could make this action maximum 1 time in 4 turns).
3. Command "ACT" can be combined with "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT" with space separation
